1. Video Data Processing (Team Member 1)
Input Data: Pre-recorded traffic videos.
Processing Steps:
Frame Extraction: Convert video into individual frames using tools like OpenCV.
Object Detection: Use YOLO or another computer vision model to detect vehicles in each frame.
Data Extraction: Count the number of vehicles, identify vehicle types (cars, trucks, etc.), and calculate their speed and direction.
Output Data: A structured dataset containing vehicle counts, types, speed, and movement patterns over time. This will be used for both training the AI model and feeding real-time data into the system when implemented with live cameras.
2. Traffic Simulation (Team Member 2)
Input Data: Parameters defining traffic scenarios (e.g., road layout, traffic volume, signal timings).
Processing Steps:
Simulation Setup: Use tools like SUMO or VISSIM to create a virtual model of the road network.
Simulate Traffic: Generate synthetic traffic data by simulating vehiclesâ€™ movements through intersections.
Data Logging: Capture data such as vehicle counts, queue lengths, average speeds, and intersection wait times.
Output Data: Simulated traffic data similar to the data extracted from videos, including vehicle counts, traffic densities, and queue lengths. This data will be used to train and test the AI model for traffic management.
3. Machine Learning Model Development (Team Member 3)
Input Data: Datasets from Video Data Processing and Traffic Simulation.
Processing Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data, handle missing values, and possibly augment the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as vehicle density, time of day, and road type to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) to predict traffic patterns and optimize signal timings.
Output Data: Trained machine learning models capable of predicting traffic patterns and suggesting optimal traffic signal timings based on the input data.
