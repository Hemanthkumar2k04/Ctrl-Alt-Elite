**A smart AI-based solution for traffic management**


**Background:** Urban areas often face significant traffic congestion, especially at intersections where multiple routes converge. Traditional traffic management systems rely on pre-set traffic light timings, which may not adapt well to fluctuating traffic conditions. This can lead to increased waiting times, fuel consumption, and emissions. 


**Description:** An AI-based traffic management system can dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic data, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. 


**Expected Solution:** Problem statement is to develop a smart, AI-based traffic management system that can monitor traffic conditions in real-time and adapt traffic light timings accordingly. The system should be capable of handling heavy traffic from multiple directions and optimizing traffic flow to minimize delays and improve overall efficiency.
